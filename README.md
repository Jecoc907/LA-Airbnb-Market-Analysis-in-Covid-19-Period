# LA-Airbnb-Market-Analysis-in-Covid-19-Period
## Introduction
In this project, we are interested in learning the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Los Angeles Airbnb Market by analyzing the data from 2018-2021. We will approach the problem using mainly by the room type and by neighborhood of the Airbnb listings.

## Conclusion
### The LA market experienced a significant impact from COVID-19, with a 30% drop in listings from peak to bottom.
- Average listing prices fell by almost 10% due to frozen demand caused by travel restrictions.
- COVID-19 significantly impacted the businesses of all four room types on Airbnb. The hotel room
sector, launched as a new service in late 2019, faced the most severe effects.
- 81.25% (13 out of 16 areas) saw a decrease in listings during COVID compared to pre-COVID.
- 5 out of 7 areas experienced a surge in median listing prices during COVID, with the highest increase reaching 13.6%.
## Limitations
### Missing data
- We are missing Airbnb listing data from 2021-02 onward, this undoubtedly undermined our ability
to get the whole picture of the market
### Omitted Factors
- According to Los Angeles Times, a new Rent Stabilization Ordinance was introduced in 2019-09.
It could be another potential factor of the Airbnb listings drop in the “Covid” period.
